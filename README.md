## Shell
I'm currently using the `ZSH` with `Oh My Zsh`

### installation
- [ZSH](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH)
    ```bash
    sudo apt install zsh
    ```
- [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)
    ```bash
    sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
    ```
### Oh My Zsh plugins
- [fast-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zdharma/fast-syntax-highlighting)
    > syntax highlighting for commands typed interactively in the terminal
- [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)
    > It suggests commands as you type based on history and completions.

## GUI Personalization
First of all to change the theme on ubuntu we'll need to install `gnome-tweaks`.
```bash
sudo apt install gnome-tweaks
```
After that you can just search for **gnome tweaks** on the menu
